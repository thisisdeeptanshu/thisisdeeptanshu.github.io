            I'm pretty sure this falls under the category of "Personal Website" and therefore,<br>
            it needs an "About Page".<br>
            So this is my "About Page"<br>
            <br>
            After going through other personal websites, I've gathered that I need to write about my interests,<br>
            what I wish to achieve in life, what I have achieved in life.<br>
            <br>
            There's just one problem:<br>
            I don't really have any interests. Like, one day, I could be interested in 3D modelling,<br>
            the next day, it could be music, or speedrunning, or programming, or not having a K/D ratio less than 1 in CS:GO.<br>
            <br>
            What do I wish to achieve in life? Ummm... no idea!<br>
            I guess as a kid, I should probably write about what I want to be when I grow up,<br>
            but, I don't know what I want to be when I grow up.<br>
            There's just so many things.<br>
            However, when my Physics teacher checked and returned my notebook, he did write "Good" but in such a way that it looked like he had written "God".<br>
            And Spotify did recommend me a song titled "Become God", so maybe I won't have to worry about that.<br>
            The song was by GHOST DATA, btw.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, and about the things I have achieved so far:<br>
            Idk.<br>
            There are some certificates that I got for the guitar,<br>
            there are also the S.O.F. Olympiads, I got a gold in Science in Class V.<br>
            I should've gotten a silver in Maths as I came second, but I didn't get it.<br>
            Also a bronze in either Maths or Science in Class VI.<br>
            But for some reason, my classmate who got a bronze in English (or maybe it was G.K.), got his medal.<br>
            The only reason I remember this is because the road I had to take to get those medals,<br>
            was flooded with pain & misery.<br>
            <br>
            I remember, when I first tried to get a medal for the Maths Olympiad in Class IV,<br>
            my dad undertook the task of teaching me, and I'm pretty sure I didn't win anything.<br>
            Next year, he didn't bother because he felt his efforts were wasted, and I got Gold and Silver in Science and Maths lol!<br>
            The only reason I got silver in Maths is because me and the person who came first both got equal marks,<br>
            just that, I got more marks attempting the simpler questions, and he got more marks from attempting the more complex ones.<br>
            The most annoying part about this was that I couldn't argue with the fact that he was more deserving of the medal,<br>
            even though we both got the same marks.<br>
            I got a bronze is Class VI, I forgot in which subject, but that's still good I guess.<br>
            I got nothing in Classes VII and VIII, but that's probably because the exam was online,<br>
            and I lost the will to live halfway through the exams, so I half-assed most of the questions.<br>
            <br><br>
            Anyway, thanks for attending my Ted Talk.<br>
            And remember, stay in school, smoke crack, and until next time,<br>
